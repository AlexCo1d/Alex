# Mathematical Arguments & Proof Techniques 
## Notation of Variables
#rob/need_formulate
	eg. $N={1,2,3,...}$, Z={...,-1,0,1,...}, Q={m/q, q!=0, no common factors} rational numbers, R=real numbers, C={a+j b, j<sup>2</sup>=-1} complex numbers

#rob/need_formulate
V means for every, for each
E means for some, there exists, for at least one
e means element of
such that s.t. 使得
	eg.  Every real number x can be arbitrarily closely approximated by a rational number, how close is defined by epsilon:
	V x e R, V epi e R, epi > 0, E q e Q
	Such that |x-q|< epi

## Logic Notation 
#rob/need_formulate 
~ means not 
A means and 
v means or
p => q means if p is true then q is true, a implication
P <=>q means p is true if and only if q is true
	(P <=> q) <=> ((p=>q) A (q=>))
