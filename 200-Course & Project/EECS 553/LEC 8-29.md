# Nearest-Neighbor Classifier
- Nearest-neighbor, k-nearest-neighbor
- Larger k means more smoothness & less complexity, controlling overfitting/ underfitting.
- As n (neighbors) increase, better for k increase.
- K-NN classifier is a discriminative, non parametric model.

title: parametric 
parametric means parameter is independent from sample size, while non-parameter is up to sample size
